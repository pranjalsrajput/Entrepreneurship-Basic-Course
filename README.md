# Entrepreneurship-Basic-Course

This repository consists of our work for the Entrepreneurship Basic Course at TU
Delft. For our assignment, we decided to choose the start-up called Paytm. 

[Paytm](https://paytm.com/) is an Indian based e-commerce company that provides services like
online payment and e-wallet. It also offers online facilities like mobile recharges,
utility bill payments, events bookings, movie tickets. Apart from those facilities
like payments at grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies, just by using Paytm
QR codes is also provided. It helps people transfer money instantly to anyone
without any additional cost or commission. It provides a user-friendly interface
and is available in 11 Indian languages. Due to this reason, several Indian
merchants use Paytm QR code for accepting the payments directly into their
bank account.

The main idea of the project is to analyze the start-up and growth stages
of a company, critical junctures and the development of the company. A detailed study is done about the company's main
value proposition, business model, revenue model, their beachhead market, etc. Also, we researched about various growth stages of the company and how it's business model changed over the period of time.
